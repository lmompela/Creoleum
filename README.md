# Creoleum

Project Creole at UM - Kr√©yolum

- Data Collection : Martinican Creole & Haitian Creole data from newspapers and blog posts
- Data Storage and pre-processing : Organizing by source, date, and language spoken.
- Creation of a language classifier that can classify text depending on the percentage of creole content it has. From 0% to 100%. Personally I need it to be at least 50% for code-switching studies
- Cleaning up of the dataset from foreign characters (i.e. non utf-8 characters) mostly. Putting it one sentence per line.


NLTK package show all characters in document.
